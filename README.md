# Full-Stack-Inventory-Management
CRUD system for clients, employees, products, and store categories.

This CRUD application was developed utilizing the XAMPP environment, with Java handling the core application logic, CSS and HTML structuring and styling the user interface, and SQL managing the relational database operations.

The system is designed for the complete administration of a grocery store's core data entities. It facilitates the management of detailed records for employees, clients, products, sales transactions, and product categories, enabling efficient data creation, reading, updating, and deletion.

A structured role-based access control system defines user permissions within the application. Guest users are granted view-only access to products and categories. Standard users can administer all data except for user registration and role management privileges. Administrators possess full, unrestricted control over the entire database. User authentication and input validation are consistently enforced throughout the project to ensure system security and integrity.
